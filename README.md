Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This repo goes along with my talk at [Enterprise NG 2020](https://www.ng-conf.org/2020/sessions/typescript-for-every-part-of-your-stack/).

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run the front end:

```bash

In a separate terminal window, run the API:

```

The app will be served at `http;//localhost:4200`.
